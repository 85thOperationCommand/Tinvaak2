# The game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Tinvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

## Gameplay

Tinvaak uses [Ordii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55200) as it's perk overhaul. This is a slightly tweaked version of Ordinator which allows for skill caps of over 100 and uses Vokrii's skill scaling.

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than only getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing monsters.

2. [Class Overhaul Re Imagined(CORI)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24808) and [Attribute Value Application(AVA)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23329) form the core of the roleplaying overhaul mods. Your character will now develop and can specialise in areas right from the start.

3. [Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890) fundamentally changes how races are done with an emphasis of putting both NPCs and the player on a even playing field. Expect a different experience from what you are used with certain races being more skilled than others in certain areas.

4. [Growl - Werebeasts of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) for overhauling Lycanthrophy and adding the option to play as a werebear.

5. [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408) is a high depth, low complexity vampire mod. It is a cleaned up and slimmed down version of Sacrosanct, offering an in-depth vampire experience without feature bloat. 

6. [Heim - Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207)provides an overhaul to smithing with minimal edits to ensure compatibility. You will need to find forging manuals in order to unlock each respective category in the forge menu.

7. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) changes loot and encounter zones to provide an open world and immersive experience, letting the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration. 

8. [Khajiit Speak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37197) is used in the Tinvaak Khajiit Speak Profile, along with many patches, as well as custom patches specific to Tinvaak.

9. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) changes Dragons so that they feel like a true boss fight, with a range of new attacks and abilities. Expect Dragons to offer a true battle to remember.

10. [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)is a complete overhaul of Skyrimâ€™s alchemy, food, and alcohol systems designed to balance existing options while adding powerful new effects to the game. This is coupled with [BA Alchemist Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) and other mods to open up many new playstyles and alchmical items.

## Magic Mods

Tinvaak comes with a a curated selection of Magic mods to fit a range of different mage archetypes.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) which adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [The Dark Arts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834) seeks to improve the Necromancy experience in Skyrim. It allows you to customize reanimated thralls, introduces rituals to create and upgrade a wide range of undead creatures, allows players to dissect corpses and harvest ingredients, reintroduces the Shade of the Revenant and adds a few Necromancy related spells

3. [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) improves and fixes vanilla Skyrim spells, makes scrolls and staves viable, and adds new spells, scrolls and staves inspired by previous Elder Scrolls magic.

4. [Summermyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285) overhauls and adds new enchantments to the world. This has been custom tweaked to ensure optimum variety and diversity.

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Tinvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396) and [Lawbringer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882) allow you to make an impact on Skyrim by clearing locations for factions or guards. Once claimed or cleared, the locations will change accordingly.

2. [HeadHunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847)expands bounty quests for Bandits, Forsworn, Giants and Dragons. Like in the Witcher 3, you can bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.

3. [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time... 

4. [OBIS SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145), [High Level Enemies Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32801), [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) and Druidic Bandits form the core of the expanded enemy system. Encounters will no longer be simple affiars, with a larger variety of bandits and more of them. Expect the unexpected.

5. [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) adds dozens of new creatures to enhance your gaming experience. This mod adds brand new creatures which fit in to the world of Skyrim, alongside variations of existing creatures, adding diversity and improving gameplay.

6. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards. 

## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

`wip`

Tinvaak uses a range of different settlement mods to try and give each location it's own unique flair. In areas where compatability or performance was sub-optimal, this has been patched and tweaked.

1. 

2. [Cities of the North Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), [Cities of the North Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168), [The Great City of Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19709) and [Capital of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34222) are used to breathe new life into the minor holds and create an experience that feels both fresh and memorable.

3. [Thanedom of Series](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42928635?tab=user+files) is a series of mods created by Axis1211 that make small and tasteful changes to the minor settlements. These individual mods have been merged together to create a master small location overhaul.

## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137) is an old bounty hunting adventurer and a brutal companion to travel with. One of the most visually customized followers made for Skyrim, Hoth has many one-of-a-kind features including being a quest giver for infinite bounty hunt contracts. 

3. [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in archery, one-handed, and sneak. 

## Music and Weather

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Tinvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Northener Diaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108) adds a selection of tasteful new soundtracks to the in game music. 

2. [Vivid Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187) is the weather mod of choice for Tinvaak. It was chosen over other weather mods for just how damn gorgeous it makes the game look.

3. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

4. [True Storms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2472) enhances the stormy nature of Skyrim and makes the rain and thunderstorms truly feel like a force of nature.

5. [Supreme and Volumetric Fog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23431) again pretty much does what it says. Expect the early morning mists to feel truly misty instead of like the steam from a kettle.

## Survival

Tinvaak comes with the option of having Survival mods should you wish to play with them. Please note they can be disabled **ON A NEW GAME ONLY.**

1. [Campsite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22353) is a simple camping mod that allows the player to build a campfire and pitch a tent. Campsite is built in the vanilla style using only existing items. It is designed to feel like an unintrusive, optional extra feature of the game that isn't noticed when not used. While camping mods with extra features already exist, the author wanted to create something simple without a perk tree, new items, spells or powers added to the magic menu.

2. [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) is a survival and needs mod. Many other survival options are either too large in scope, or too lightweight and do not have full survival features. The author wanted SunHelm to bridge the gap where a full feature mod was needed, but in a somewhat lightweight and performance friendly manner.
