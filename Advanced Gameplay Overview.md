# Advanced Gameplay

Tinvaak 2 has gone as far as it can on the notion that you can be anyone you can imagine. To better facilitate this, we have added several alternate progression paths to fully flesh out some character archetypes which may not seem fully realized even when modded.

## [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780)

Custom Skills Framework is the foundation upon which our gameplay loop is built. In previous iterations, we have been restricted to changing or replacing the perk trees already present, with meh321’s Custom Skills Framework, we can create access points for as many additional perks as we like, all of them fitting specific themes. In the spirit of roleplaying, some names may appear with a quote to give you a bit of the theming of said alternate progression whether from a practitioner of said path, or even a piece of music for inspiration. Who knows maybe you may hear from these characters in the future? As one of our community managers, mint, is fond of saying ‘It is a mystery’.

“Your money or your life cat!” – Freki Irongrin, Wanted by the Jarl of Whiterun for theft, murder and vagrancy

“Ahhh this one was yearning to shake off the chill of these cold sands. Now to be like the desert wind yes?” – Do’aydi Almas Eslweyri Acolyte of the Sirocco

Ever wanted to roleplay a character whose body was their weapon and did not need armour to protect themselves? Tinvaak 2 has got you covered. Simply take a trip Northeast of Whiterun and visit the Shrine of the Pugilist. Interact with the Diamond of the Grand Champion to access the perk tree and demonstrate that bringing or justice or tyranny to the land of Skyrim can be done with a fist just as well as blade, arcana or miracle. If you wish to meditate on what you have learned, but are otherwise unable to return to Whiterun (if you’re mad enough to assault Apocrypha with a closed fist and determination as your only equipment) simply purchase the Statue of the Grand Champion to carry your enlightenment with you. A true warrior needs nothing but their body and the will to use it. Should you feel you need an edge against enemies who only magicka can harm, look no further than the aspirant doubling as a merchant at the Shrine itself, he may be able to sell you an item or two to allow your hands to hold an enchantment just as well as any blade could.

In addition no bare handed pugilist, monk, fencer or any other who disdains armour would be complete without some progression, so travel northwest to the Shrine of the Unarmoured One in the Whiterun tundra. Simply touch the Statue of the Unarmoured one, bring the power of the shrine with you in your travels.

“The radiance of the aedra still coursed through him and answered his calls! The blight will take me but at least, I won’t dance like a puppet that he holds the strings to! Physician, leave me with my sword and dignity, I can feel it taking hold….he still had the blessing. He said we would need our strength and he would test us, until we could withstand what awaited….the black tears…like blood gone foul…please…I don’t want to die like they did…” – Final testament of encounter with Maleficum and Blackguard of Stendarr Soren the Blackblood by Speculatore Julianus Octavian, Legio Tactica, Tribune for the Vigilants of Stendarr, Fallen in the line of duty

Far to the west of the Whiterun tundra over which Dragonsreach looms is a solitary shrine to Stendarr tended to by a few vigilants. The Radiance of Stendarr calls many to serve irrelevant to race or creed, only the need for justice quickening action is the only motive asked. Should one meditate here fervently and truthfully while wearing a medallion of Stendarr, they will find that they will be given the power to chase back the darkness with every undead, beast or daedra that falls before them.

### [Custom Skills (Haemophilia)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46632) 

“The Volkihar aren’t the only ones to plumb the depths of Sanguinaire Vampiris you know. There are several flavours of blood sucking horror. Personally I cleaned out Belethor of all the silverware and candelabrum he had. Can’t have enough silver on hand” – Upon Further Reflection, Argonian Siegebreaker Alchemist on Vampires

A Mysterious Skull has made it into the hands of travelers coming to Skyrim alongside a strange book and none of them remember ever picking up either of them. Rumour has it that under certain circumstances the skull and book will whisper, providing forbidden knowledge in exchange for blood and souls. How badly do you want power and what price will you pay for it?

## Magic & Alchemy

### [The Dark Arts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834)

“You see, herein lies the problem. The Aedra have abandoned us, letting the Daedra have free reign to do whatever they like. They can corrupt, murder and do as they like with even souls and not a single one of you can stop them. If they can do this with free reign, why do we have to stand idly by? Mannimarco had the right idea, he just lacked vision. Death is the perfect weapon to wield against the Aedra themselves and they have one of two options. They can come down here and stop me, in which case I have gotten them to pay attention, or they’re too weak to stop me in which case I’ll just replace them and reshape things so everyone has a fair shot. I don’t need your paltry scrolls and your adorable excuse for an Arcanum. I don’t need any of you and you can get out of my way or your corpses will do my bidding.” – Valgus Vincendus, Oracle of Worms as his banishment from the College of Winterhold was enacted.

De Vermis Mysteriis is a tome that takes many shapes and keeps popping up in the hands of people who are just arrogant enough to think they can master death while having the skill and ambition to do just that. Sometimes the text is unintelligible and the book disappears as quickly as it came at the bottom of a pack through no action of its benefactor’s own. It is the object of many a Witch Hunter’s hunt and the Wardens of Winterhold because firsthand accounts differ, but for those whom the book reveals its secrets to, the dead walk and souls are theirs to command.

### [The Badass Alchemist’s Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030)

“Oh surprised at the line being broken so easily? They don’t call me Siegebreaker for nothing Breton. A pinch of sulphur, some powerful vinegar, a dash of ingenuity and some rags for a wick and I’ll put any Pyromancer to shame. I also do nameday parties if you can cover the cost of my ingredients and a night at the inn. Now stand back, they seem to be recovering and I have a new mixture I want to test, got an arrow I can have? I’ll be fine but your lungs will dissolve like sweetroll frosting on a hot day if you get anywhere near this.” – Upon Further Reflection, Argonian Siege Alchemist, wanted for crimes against the Empire and violation of the White Gold Concordat and the murder of Thalmor officials as they were performing their duties

Certain Alchemists have honed their craft in such a fashion that they are an order of magnitude above your standard Apothecary. Through alchemy, ingenuity and just a little madness they can create compounds which can rival even the foolhardiest of mages. Always be leery of opponents carrying several flasks and vials and a smile that screams that they know something you don’t.

### [ScrollScribe SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439)

“Wait you mean all that stands between me and summoning things to do my bidding is formatting and syntax? This is leagues more ridiculous than I thought. Bulk quills and vellum please, here’s 1000 septims, I have plans to enact” – Upon Further Reflection, Argonian Siege Alchemist to Urag Gro-Shub before being promptly informed of the rules of the Arcaneum

Ever wanted to enhance yourself with magicka but did not have the aptitude to join the College of Winterhold? With a little ingenuity, practice and special inks and vellum you too can channel your inner artificer and plumb the same depths as mages. Don’t worry, we won’t tell about that strange mortar you have that seems to glitter as if lined with fragments of soul gems.

## Mechanics

### Hand to Hand (Pugilist)
-	Touch the Diamond of the Grand Champion or use the statuette in your inventory named [Perk] Hand To Hand to access the perk tree.
-	The Pugilist skills scale off their own skill progression, titled Hand to Hand. It advances via attacks made with your bare hands or weapons that use the Hand to hand animations.
-	The higher the level of enemy you defeat, the more experience granted to the Hand to hand skill. Every level of skill divisible by 4 grants a perk point you can use on Pugilist perks.
-	Some perks need a weapon in order to work correctly, simply purchase the Hand to Hand items from the same merchant at the shrine who sold you the statue. This will also allow you to place enchantments on your unarmed attacks.
-	The merchant at the shrine also sells scrolls that deploy training dummies which you can use to practice on and even decorate your home.
-	Unused perk points can be turned into standard perk points using the Sword of the Grand Champion at the Shrine of the Pugilist.
-	You will need to make Hand to Hand legendary regularly if you wish to grab all the perks, buy a training dummy to gain skill back after doing so.

### Unarmoured Defense
-	Touch the Statue of the Unarmoured One, or purchase an item named [Perk] Unarmoured Defense to access the perk menu
-	Unarmoured means Naked, Clothed or in Robes, anything that has the ArmourLight or ArmourHeavy keywords will use the relevant skills instead of Unarmoured.
-	You will remain unarmoured even if using, Alteration Protection spells, a Ward Spell or a shield for your inner fencer.
-	The Unarmoured skill increases when you are attacked while unarmoured. Defending against your opponent’s attacks will make it more simple to advance, so block and dodge often. Should you want the ultimate raving lunatic playthrough, you gain triple skill experience while naked.
-	Similar to Hand to Hand, unused perk points can be turned into standard perk points at the shrine by interacting with the bonfire, a perk point in Unarmoured Defense is granted at every level of skill divisible by 4 and you can repeatedly flag the skill as legendary to get more Unarmoured skill points.

### Vigilant
-	Sound the Horn of Stendarr located at the Shrine of Stendarr located between Whiterun and Roriikstead, or purchase the [Perk] Idol of Stendarr to access the Perk Menu.
-	As a skill tree devoted to the tenets of the Vigilants of Stendarr, you must be wearing an Amulet of Stendarr to gain experience in the Vigilance skill.
-	The Vigilance Skill advances when you defeat Witches, Warlocks, Necromancers, Werecreatures and Daedra.
-	When you increase the Vigilance skill, you will gain perk points for use in the tree which will all empower you against the enemies of the Vigil.

### Haemophilia
-	Simply interact with the Mysterious Skull in your inventory to access the skill tree. Note, you will not be able to advance the Vampirism skill unless you are a vampire.
-	Advance the Vampirism skill by feeding normally to unlock augmentations to your condition and even get a taste of the strength given Vampire Lords in your normal human form.

### The Dark Arts
-	Simply use the book titled De Vermis Mysteriis or “Mysteries of the Wyrm” to bring up the menu for the Dark Arts
-	The tome itself will act as both spellbook and mentor to you by adding a separate Necromancy skill you can advance by trapping souls, casting necromancy spells, performing rituals, creating undead, reanimating the dead, dissecting corpses, harvesting ingredients, studying corpses and binding souls.
-	To begin your journey to lord and master of the zombie horde tweak the settings to your liking by first choosing how your character practices their craft.
-	Mundane: you require all 4 embalming tools in your inventory to create corporeal undead and to perform dissections. The animus for your new creations will need to be provided in the form of souls in soul gems.
-	Arcane: Substitute magicka for the requirements in mundane, meaning all you need is Souls to feed your new book turned mentor
-	Shade of the Revenant: This is disabled by default. When enabled it can be used to create black soul gems from empty grand soul gems as you could in Oblivion. This is performed at an altar outside the entrance of Rannveig’s Fast.
-	Next Chapter: This option leads you deeper into the book to learn the new perks and spells offered by this mod. After becoming an initiate, advancing your skill requires leveling your Necromancy skill and a steady diet of souls.

### The Badass Alchemist’s Arsenal
-	Simply visit an Alchemy vendor and purchase ‘The Alchemist Arsenal Guide’ in one of the major cities.
-	This book will teach you to create an Alchemist’s Kit, which will allow you to create your components and new unique alchemical weaponry including Bombs, Traps and special Arrows and Bolts.
-	All of your creations scale with your Alchemy skill and your creations scale with their own progression system. Periodically check your kit so that once you have hit a new power threshold your existing items and new creations can benefit from a power increase!

### ScrollScribe SE
-	Grinding down soul gems for magical ink, an inkwell, a quill, some paper and some patience, you can in fact create scrolls even of Master level spells and concentration spells as a specific advantage to scribes allowing you to add a dash of magicka to even dual wield builds.
-	Create scrolls via the simple user menu to add a flair of magicka to any build! Magicka for all even mod added spells included by default!
